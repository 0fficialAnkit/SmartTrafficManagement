# SmartTrafficManagement


The Problem It Solves  

Traffic congestion, overspeeding, and inefficient traffic signal control are major issues in urban areas. Traditional traffic lights follow a fixed timer system, leading to unnecessary waiting even when there are no vehicles. This causes frustration among drivers, fuel wastage, and increased pollution. Additionally, overspeeding is a serious problem that leads to accidents, but manually tracking and penalizing violators is time-consuming and inefficient.  

How Our Solution Helps  :-

Our Smart Traffic Management System leverages AI and computer vision to make roads safer and improve traffic flow. It integrates three key features:  
->Vehicle Speed Monitoring– The system detects vehicle speeds using CCTV footage and flags overspeeding vehicles automatically. This helps in reducing accidents and ensuring better enforcement of speed limits.  
->Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** – Our system uses AI-based OCR to read vehicle number plates, even in low-light conditions. This helps in identifying traffic rule violators and keeping a record of vehicles passing through an area.  
->Dynamic Traffic Light Control** – Instead of using a fixed timer, the traffic lights adjust dynamically based on real-time traffic data. If one side of the road has heavy traffic and the other is clear, the system prioritizes the busy side to reduce waiting time and improve traffic movement.  

Benefits of Our System  :-

->Reduced Traffic Jams – The intelligent traffic light system ensures smoother movement and avoids unnecessary stops.  
->Improved Road Safety – Speeding vehicles are detected instantly, helping authorities take action.  
->Quick and Accurate Vehicle Identification – The ANPR system identifies vehicles in real time, making it easy to track violators.  
->Lower Fuel Consumption & Pollution – With better traffic flow and reduced idling at signals, fuel wastage and emissions are minimized.
