# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System  

## 📌 Vision  
Our vision is to revolutionize urban traffic management by harnessing the power of **AI, computer vision, and automation**. We aim to create **smarter, safer, and more efficient roads** where technology optimizes traffic flow, enforces road safety, and reduces congestion—all without human intervention.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Smart Traffic Management System** is an **AI-powered solution** designed to improve **road safety and traffic efficiency**. The system consists of:  

✅ **Vehicle Speed Monitoring** – Detects over-speeding vehicles using CCTV footage.  
✅ **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** – Uses OCR to read vehicle plates.  
✅ **Dynamic Traffic Light Control** – Adjusts signals based on real-time congestion data.  

This project integrates **computer vision, AI, and automation** to reduce human intervention and enforce traffic laws more efficiently.

## 🔧 Dependencies  
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Python 3.9+**  
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-python`) – For image processing  
- **NumPy** (`numpy`) – For numerical computations  
- **Pandas** (`pandas`) – For handling tabular data  
- **TensorFlow** (`tensorflow`) – For AI-based recognition  
- **Tesseract OCR** (`pytesseract`) – For text recognition from images  

To install dependencies, run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# 🔧Configure Environment

## Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed and configured:
```bash
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr  # (Linux)
```
**For Windows, set the Tesseract path in the script.

# 🚀 Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```
**The system will process live video footage, detect traffic violations, and store license plate details in an Excel file.
